                The busiest area is towards the south end of the beach, where you will find budget accommodation and plenty of simple beer stations, tea houses and souvenir shops. Higher end restaurants tend to be found at the better hotels, but there is an atmospheric little sea food place called Annawa Pathein that can be found at the south end of the village, where you can see the freshly caught catch before digging into your meal with lovely views of the bay. 

                Classic beach activities are aplenty in Chaung Tha, including horse riding, bicycle and quad bike hire and inflatable rings. For the more adventurous, there are two islands that can be visited nearby: a larger one directly to the south of the main beach, which can be explored by foot and has a hilltop pagoda at its northern headland, with great views out to sea; and a smaller sand and rock island which can be seen on the horizon from the main beach (trips by boat cost K5,000 per person to the large island and K9,000 per person to the sand island).

                        Overall, your personal med kits should be pretty basic. Outside of personal prescriptions and a few over-the-counter medications, the main thing you will need are supplies to treat hot spots and blisters. As you are getting your personal first aid kits ready for the mountain, here are a few considerations. This is by no means a comprehensive list of what you need.
                        Please discuss all medication below with your primary care provider. I highly recommend a travel consultation with a provider familiar with the area and a provider that is experienced in high-altitude illness. These recommendations do not take into account individual allergies or contraindications to medications you may be taking, so it is especially important to speak with your provider prior to taking any medications.
                        I like to use a tape called Leukotape for hot spots if the skin is not broken. Leukotape sticks to skin better than anything else including duct tape and can be easily ordered or found at a pharmacy or drug store. Get the brand name stuff! Have a few alcohol pads to clean the skin with first. One roll of Leukotape will go a very long way, so every person does not need their own roll. Have a small pair of sharp scissors that will cut it.

                    SAGAING HILL ADVENTURE
                <br>
                   
                    
                    <p>
                        Sagaing is located just 12 miles from Mandalay and can be reached by crossing the long Sagaing Bridge over the Irrawaddy River. The city is a frequent tourist destination for day trips. Many people who visit Mandalay will also make a trip across the Irrawaddy River to the town of Sagaing. It known as the Centre of Buddhism in Myanmar and it has more than 300 religious buildings. It is a beautiful and peaceful place with lush, tree-covered hills but most tourists only make a quick visit spending 2 or 3 hours exploring two or three main sites.

                        Sagaing was the capital of Sagaing Kingdom (1315-1364), and one of the minor kingdoms that rose up after the fall of Bagan Dynasty. Today, the city is part of Mandalay area with more than 1,022,000 inhabitants (2011 estimate).

                        One of the most popular tourist attractions on Sagaing Hills is Soon U Ponya Shin pagoda. It is connected by a set of covered staircase that runs up the 240 meters hill and is one of the oldest temples on Sagaing Hills. It was built in 1312 by Minister Pon Nya. A Pagoda Festival is held on Full Moon Day of Warso, the fourth month of Myanmar Calendar, which falls in July of each year.

                        <p style="color: white;">
                            Staring distantly towards Mandalay Palace, temple-topped Yankin Hill is worth climbing for views of greater Mandalay's rice-field setting and of the Shan foothills behind. After a 10-minute climb along the obvious covered stairway, you're likely to encounter a couple of domesticated stags – feeding them supposedly brings Buddhist merit. Pagoda walkways turn south along the ridgetop, eventually ducking into a rocky cleft where devotees splash water on tacky golden fish statues that lie at the feet of a Buddha image.

                            Cars and motorbikes can drive almost to the top of the hill from the southeast. Some pick-up 5 (၅) services terminate near the 19th St stairway.
                            
                            Around 300yd back towards Mandalay, then 300yd north, Mya Kyauk monastery has a dazzlingly distinctive brassy stupa and is famed for its water. A taxi out this way will cost around K5000 return (or around K3000 for a motorcycle taxi).</p>

                        “They maintain the routes from the base camp to the summit, have lots of porters and it’s easy to find people by air if they’re missing. That’s not the case on Hkakabo Razi.”

                        The first known attempt to scale the mountain was by British explorer and botanist Frank Kingdon-Ward in 1936. 
                        
                        In his book “Burma’s Icy Mountains”, he describes how the peak “utterly defeated” him, forcing him to turn back a vertical kilometre below the top.
                        
                        It took another 60 years before Japanese mountaineer Takashi Ozaki and his Myanmar climbing partner Nyima Gyaltsen prevailed on their third attempt.
                        
                        Ozaki, the first-ever climber to successfully tackle Mount Everest’s north face, reportedly described the peak as “one of the most difficult and dangerous mountains in the world”.
                        
                        Two separate expeditions in 2014 both met with costly failure.
                        
                        One local Myanmar team never returned, a tragedy magnified when a rescue helicopter crashed, killing one pilot.</p>
