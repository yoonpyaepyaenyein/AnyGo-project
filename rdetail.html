                CHAUNG THAR BEACH
            <br>  
             <p style="color: white;">
                The busiest area is towards the south end of the beach, where you will find budget accommodation and plenty of simple beer stations, tea houses and souvenir shops. Higher end restaurants tend to be found at the better hotels, but there is an atmospheric little sea food place called Annawa Pathein that can be found at the south end of the village, where you can see the freshly caught catch before digging into your meal with lovely views of the bay. 

                Classic beach activities are aplenty in Chaung Tha, including horse riding, bicycle and quad bike hire and inflatable rings. For the more adventurous, there are two islands that can be visited nearby: a larger one directly to the south of the main beach, which can be explored by foot and has a hilltop pagoda at its northern headland, with great views out to sea; and a smaller sand and rock island which can be seen on the horizon from the main beach (trips by boat cost K5,000 per person to the large island and K9,000 per person to the sand island). </p>

                BAGAN 
            <br>
               
           <p style="color: white;">
            The thousands of temples that are spread across the plains of Bagan (sometimes spelt Pagan)
             are the most impressive testament to the religious devotion of Myanmar’s people – and ruler
             s – over the centuries. They combine to form one of the richest archaeological sites in Asia 
             and provide views quite unlike anywhere else on earth. For practical information on restaurants
             , ATMs, accommodation and trasport, visit our towns of Bagan page.

            One of the beauties of spending time in what is now officially called the Bagan Archaeological
             Zone (which also comprises four main settlements) is that, once you have paid your K25,000 entry 
             fee, you have the freedom to explore this vast and fascinating area at your own leisure – the entry 
             ticket is valid for three days. Bagan is in general more touristy and possibly less of the ‘real Myanmar’ 
             than other parts of the country, but despite obvious sales ploys such as the multitudes of children selling 
             hand-drawn postcards, you will rarely suffer the hard sell – and the locals remain warm and friendly.</p>

                        Along with fishing, traditional handicrafts are an important part of the local economy, and you will get to see silk weavers and silversmiths plying their trade on the lake. And as with all of Myanmar, religion plays a massive part in local life, and numerous pagodas and monasteries can be found on the lake and its shores. There also are many restaurants dotted around, where you can indulge in their delicious catches of the day.

                        Inle is one of Myanmar’s most popular destinations for travellers, so when you travel around the lake, part of what you see will inevitably be geared towards tourists. You may be taken to one too many handicraft workshops, as most guides get commission on sales, and negative examples of tourism development can be seen in everything from environmental degradation to the Kayan women found selling items in some village shops, wearing the traditional rings which elongate their necks; taking photos of them is encouraged, but the tribe is not in fact indigenous to this area - their own home is in the hills south west of Loikaw.

                    <p>
                        The colonial hill station of Pyin Oo Lwin (Pyin U Lwin) was a summer retreat during British rule, its altitude of 1,070m 
                        and relatively cool climate allowing the British ruling class to escape the fearsome heat of Mandalay and lower Myanmar.
                         During that era, the town was called Maymyo (meaning ‘May’s town’ in Burmese, after a British colonel who was stationed there), 
                         and is still sometimes referred to this way tod
                        Although now blighted by more recent building developments, Pyin Oo Lwin’s colonial legacy still holds the key to the town’s 
                        charm and the surrounding area offers plenty to explore, including a number of magnficent waterfalls.
                        Pyin Oo Lwin’s beautiful botanical gardens are unique in Myanmar and the town itself does retain a number of characteristic
                         examples of 19th century country houses, several of which are now hotels. The most famous is The Candacraig, a colonial mansion 
                         built in 1904 and described in some detail by Paul Theroux in The Great Railway Bazaar; although currently closed, it is sometimes 
                         possible to find your way inside. Another beautiful example is the Governor’s House.

                            Strand Road (Kanna Lan in Burmese), which lines the waterfront, is a great place to start exploring Myeik – 
                            and if you arrive by boat from Dawei or Kawthaung, you will be dropped off at the jetty here. The life of the town 
                            is centred on this bustling road, and it offers the best views of the fishermen and their boats. Myeik’s night market
                             at the southern end of Strand Road, and at its northern end you will find Shwe Yar Su restaurant, which offers great 
                             food, fantastic service and a vibrant atmosphere.
                                The Theindawgyi Pagoda, located on a hill in the centre of Myeik, offers lovely views across the town and harbour. If you walk 20 minutes north
                                from here along Bogyoke Road as far as Mingalar Lake , you will find Myeik’s market; clock tower; a number of charming colonial-era buildings; 
                                and a fire station with old fire trucks. To the east of Mingalar Lake is another good place to eat - the classy Mergui de Kitchen, housed in a 
                                colonial-era building that was once the top hotel in town.</p>

                    <p style="color: white;">
                        Mawlamyine is  the fourth largest city in Myanmar situated 180 kilometers east of the nation's capital across the Gulf of Mottama at the mouth of the Thanlwin river. It is the capital of Mon State with a population of about 400,000 people. Formerly known as Moulmein, it was once a major port and the administrative capital of British Lower Burma. The town's signature landmark is Kyaikthanlan pagoda built in 875 AD and  thought to be the site from where Rudyard Kipling wrote his famous poem, 'The Road to Mandalay'.

                        The Thanlwin bridge, the longest road and rail bridge in Myanmar is the most prominent landmark in the area. It stretches a distance of 11,000 feet over the Thanlwin river connecting the country's south eastern region with Yangon.
                        
                        Mawlamyine is generally considered to be off the main tourist trail for most travellers to Myanmar but the town does have a charm of its own with its rich history, buildings with colonial style architecture, World War II era wooden buses, and its close proximity to the infamous Siam-Burma "death railway", making it a fascinating place to visit!
